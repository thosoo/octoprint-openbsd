This is fork of pyzeroconf, Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python,
originally by Paul Scott-Murphy (https://github.com/paulsm/pyzeroconf),
modified by William McBrine (https://github.com/wmcbrine/pyzeroconf).

The original William McBrine's fork note:

   This fork is used in all of my TiVo-related projects: HME for Python (and
   therefore HME/VLC), Network Remote, Remote Proxy, and pyTivo.  Before this,
   I was tracking the changes for zeroconf.py in three separate repos.
   I figured I should have an authoritative source.

Although I make changes based on my experience with TiVos, I expect that
they're generally applicable. This version also includes patches found on the
now-defunct (?) Launchpad repo of pyzeroconf, and elsewhere around the net --
not always well-documented, sorry.  Compatible with:

   - Bonjour
   - Avahi

Compared to some other Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi Python packages, python-zeroconf:

   - isn't tied to Bonjour or Avahi
   - doesn't use D-Bus
   - doesn't force you to use particular event loop or Twisted
   - is pip-installable
   - has PyPI distribution
